  <h3 class="w3-center">ABOUT ME</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em> UX Designer by day, Bowler by night</em></p>
  <p> Hello! I am a senior undergraduate student at the University of California, Irvine where I am double majoring in Informatics with a specialization in Human-Computer Interaction, and Linguistics. 
    My experiences at UCI have sparked my passion for UX Design and front-end development, which I hope to pursue after I graduate. I want to be able to create clean and accessible designs that can 
    be universally beneficial. I take everyday as a learning opportunity and am excited to find something that will allow me to grow both personally and professionally. </p>

      <h3 class="w3-center w3-xlarge"> THE APP: THUUZ SPORTS </h3>
      <p> Thuuz is a mobile sports application that provides its users with game statistics and highlights of 
        their favorite sports. However, the app differentiantes itself from its competitors with an unique algorithm that determines
        the excitement of games and ranks them based on a numerical scale from 0-100. Although it is a promising feature, 
        it is unfortunately masked by the various usability issues found through user research our team conducted.</p>

  <div class="w3-modal-content w3-center w3-transparent w3-padding-64">
    <h3 class="w3-center w3-xlarge"> USABILITY ISSUES </h3>
    <div class="w3-modal-content w3-padding-32">
      <p class="w3-xlarge"><em> <b>Information Overload </b></em></p>
      <img src="images/InformationOverload.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Usability Issue">
      <p> Users were confused and overwhelmed with the amount of information being presented. For example, too many games were displayed at once. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-modal-content w3-padding-32">
      <p class="w3-xlarge"><em> <b> Bad Use of Color & Font </b> </em></p>
      <img src="images/BadUseScreens.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Usability Issue">
      <p> Users had a hard time with the representation of buttons and fonts. This disabled users to find buttons for the actions they were looking for. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-modal-content w3-padding-32">
      <p class="w3-xlarge"><em><b> Counter-Intuitive Navigation </b></em></p>
      <img src="images/CIntuitive.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Usability Issue">
      <p> The navigation of the app has several aspects that are counter-intuitive and do not follow industry standards, which caused confusion in our users. 
        No clear indication of swiping left or right for date navigation, indicators were hard to see. Inconsistent labels and formats for dates. One screen 
        displayed "Later Today" while the next displayed "12/31" as an example. </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="w3-modal-content w3-padding-32">
      <p class="w3-xlarge"><em> <b>Confusion of Excitement Score </b></em></p>
      <img src="images/ExcitementScoreScreens.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Usability Issue">
      <p> Users did not find the excitement score easily and questioned the purpose of it. This is significant because the excitement score is the feature 
          that sets it apart from other competitors, yet it is muddled by all the present usability issues. Furthermore, our users could not find additional
          information in the game page that explained the match's current excitement score. </p>

      <img class="w3-image designImage" src="images/feedScreen.png" alt="Picture of Feed Screen">
      <p> The original design crowded too much information within the homepage. Our new design separates and prioritizes information. This allows users to 
      find what they're looking for almost immediately. In addition, we added an universal search functionality, which also allows users to make searches 
      and a filter option in which they can choose what information they want to see on their feed. </p>

      <img class="w3-image" src="images/Inspiration.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Usability Issue">
      <p> We adhered to Nielsen's Heuristics when designing the new interface and took inspiration from the following applications: Tumblr, and the App Store (iOS).
         Tumblr has a quick and easy-to-use, pop-up navigation for posting content which users can access any time. The App Store displays its content through the
          use of card-like tiles which present information in a clear and minimal way. </p>

        <p class="w3-center"> Our sponsor is a non-profit organization dedicated to serving at-risk families in Orange County. Their purpose is to provide these families support,
            by enrolling kids in head start programs and empowering the parents by providing them tools to ensure the success of their children</p>
      </div>
    </div>

  <div class="w3-modal-content w3-center w3-transparent w3-padding-64">
    <h3 class="w3-center"> THE PROBLEM </h3>
    <p>The application process for the program acts like a black-box; parents could not see their application status or know which document forms they needed
        to submit. As a result, the centers would be flooded with calls and staff members often had to work long hours to update applications manually. In
        addition, our sponsor informed us that some of the families were having difficulty finding OC Head Start offices to submit their paperwork to.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="w3-modal-content w3-center w3-transparent w3-padding-64">
    <h3 class="w3-center"> OUR SOLUTION </h3>
    <p>To create a website which informs parents of their current application status. This would allow parents to know which forms they have submitted, as well 
      as any other form they may be missing. In addition, we wanted to display a map in the website, in which parents could look up which center is closest to 
      their current location. </p>

        <p><em> <b> Requirements Elicitation </b></em></p>
        <img src="images/reqselicitation.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Picture of requirements document">
        <p> As a team, we regularly met with our sponsor to gather requirements necessary for the construction of our website. Because we were tasked to simulate 
          an Agile environment, this made it easy to have room for flexibility in the requirements. I was in charge of creating and overseeing the development of 
          the System Requirements Document. I decided to use the IEEE 830-1998 template since it met our needs and fit well with the context of the project. </p>

        <p><em><b> Explanation </b></em></p>
        <p> Incremental design of our high-fidelity prototype. The styles changed as we gathered more information from our sponsor, so that it reflected the mission
            of the website. I was in charge of adding functionality to the pages by using PHP and MySQL. I was also in charge of developing the document display where
            parents can see what documents they are missing. This information was extracted using SQL queries from the database our team developed. </p>

    <div class="w3-modal-content w3-center w3-transparent w3-padding-64">
      <h3 class="w3-center"> FINAL PRODUCT </h3>
      <p>Although we faced some limitations due to government regulations on non-profit organizations, we were able to create something that followed their rules and that 
        could potentially resolve the influx of calls.</p>

        <h3 class="w3-center"> THE REAL-WORLD PROBLEM: CLIMATE CHANGE</h3>
        <p class="w3-center"> Our team decided to try and find a solution that could help bring awareness to or provide some sort of relief to climate change.
          We acknowledged that it is a large and difficult issue, so we found a niche topic that was doable and still addresses climate change and sustainability.
          We found fast fashion to have one of the biggest impacts on the environment, yet not a lot of people know so, or even know what fast fashion is.
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="w3-modal-content w3-center w3-transparent w3-padding-64">
      <h3 class="w3-center"> OUR SOLUTION </h3>
      <p> Because we found out people did not know much about fast fashion and its effects on the environment, we wanted to educate others and give them
          alternatives to the fast fashion clothes they are prone to buy. We came up with the idea to create an AR app that allows people to scan any clothing item 
          and are thus given sustainable clothing alternatives.

      <div class="w3-modal-content w3-padding-32">
          <p class="w3-large"><em> <b> Lean UX </b> </em></p>
          <p> Throughout the development process, we used Lean UX methodologies to create a minimal viable product (MVP) and to create 
              an app that could be further developed in the future. We essentially treated the project as if we were a startup company. </p>
          
          <p class="w3-large w3-padding-32"><em> <b> Lean Canvas </b></em></p>

          <img src="images/valuePropositionCanvas.png" style="width: 100%" alt="picture of Lean Canvas">

          <p> We created the Lean Canvas and the Value Proposition Canvas to better understand the practices that would drive our product forth,
            as well as understanding our users and how our product would be of use to them. Through this, we were able to determine what our MVP would be 
            and how it sets us apart from our potential competitors.
          </p>
      </div>

      <div class="w3-modal-content w3-padding-32">
        <p class="w3-large"><em> <b> Prototyping </b></em></p>
        <img class="designImage" src="images/sustainifyPrototype.gif" alt="Image of hi-fi prototype">
        <p> Our team developed some high-fidelity prototypes to better envision what we wanted to create and also to conduct usability tests on. 
          We wanted a minimalistic design with an earthy vibe, not only for the aesthetics but to reflect our mission. We wanted our users to remember
          that our creation was more than just a fashion app. The prototypes were developed with Marvel.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="w3-modal-content w3-padding-32">
        <p class="w3-xlarge"><em><b> Usability Tests </b></em></p>
        <p> We conducted 3 different types of testing throughout our development process. We wanted to ensure our project was intuitive and that our overall goal 
            of bringing awareness about fast fashion and climate change was present in our product. </p>
        
          <!-- Prototype testing-->
        <!-- <div class="w3-modal-content w3-padding-32"> -->
          <p class="w3-large w3-padding-32"> <em> <b> Prototype Testing </b></em></p>
          <p> Our first round of testing was around our finished high-fidelity prototype. We created 5 think-aloud tasks that would test whether our users were understanding the 
              flow and purpose of our app. 
              <ol>
                <li> Find sustainable alternative to clothing item </li>
                <li> Save a sustainable clothing item into your collections </li>
                <li> Go to "my closet" </li>
                <li> Search if a specific brand is sustainable or not </li>
                <li> Go to the website where you can actually purchase sustainable recommendation </li>
              </ol>

        <div class="w3-modal-content w3-padding-32">
          <p class="w3-padding-32"> <b> Results</b> </p>
          <p> Our participants reported that although the flow of the application was intuitive, 
              the metrics that we used to report the sustainability of a brand/item were confusing and
              did not help much. They also reported that they wanted to see a price filter for the 
              recommended sustainable items. There seemed to be a small disconnect between our mission and our actual
              prototypes. </p>

        <div class="w3-modal-content w3-padding-32">
          <p class="w3-large w3-padding-32"> <em> <b> Interviews </b></em></p>
          <p> For our second round of testing, we developed interviews to improve the connection between our application
              and our overall mission of bringing awareness about sustainability and fast fashion. We wanted to gauge how much
              our target users currently care or know about both topics, and we also asked questions about the introductory
              slides to ensure that they were as effective as possible.

        <div class="w3-modal-content w3-padding-32">
          <p class="w3-padding-32"> <b> Results</b> </p>
          <p> We were able to learn that most of our participants are aware of climate change and some of them take measures to practice sustainability. We also were able to 
              pinpoint that although our app discusses sustainability, we never explicitly mentioned anything about climate change as a whole, which was significant to our misison. 
              The following table summarizes the results of all our collective interviews based on each question. </p>

        <div class="w3-modal-content w3-padding-32">
          <p class="w3-large"> <em> <b> Surveys </b></em></p>
          <p> For our third and last round of testing, we wanted to better understand the habits of our users in terms of shopping and sustainable habits. We also wanted to understand
              what type of information users were looking for when presented with sustainable brands. This in turn would help us present relatable data on our product recommendations
              page. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="w3-modal-content w3-padding-32">
          <p class="w3-padding-32"> <b> Results</b> </p>
          <p> We were able to determine that most of our users do practice sustainability and are aware of what climate change is. In terms of shopping habits, our users
              were very price conscious and reported that they would probably opt for fast fashion items if cheaper than the more eco-friendly alternatives. As a result, we figured that
              we needed to find a way to account for this factor when developing our product. We also found that our users wanted to know if brands followed ethical practices such as being
              cruelty-free, used eco-friendly materials, their use of renewable energy, and labor practices. </p>
          
              <p> Below are some of the results from 4 of the 21 questions in our survey. </p>

        <img src="images/devTools.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Picture of Development Tool Logos">
        <p> In terms of the actual development of the app, the engineers in our team (another teammate and myself)
            decided to use React Native as our development framework to account for both iOS and Android users. Because we really wanted to focus on creating
            our MVP and due to the time restriction on the project, we chose to use existing APIs to simulate an AR application that could scan clothes.
            We chose the following resources: 
            <ul>
              <li> <b> Clarifai</b>: Machine-learning based API that can recognize apparel from an image. </li>
              <li> <b> Google Cloud Vision: </b> API that can extract dominant colors from an image. </li>
              <li> <b> ShopStyle: </b> API to query sustainable alternatives from the results of our previous API calls. </li>
              <li> <b> Color-Namer.js:</b> JavaScript library that names the most approximate color of the hexadecimal value. </li>
            </ul>
      <!-- </div> -->

      <div class="w3-modal-content w3-center w3-transparent w3-padding-64">
          <h3 class="w3-center"> FINAL PRODUCT </h3>
          <p> We were able to complete our MVP for the project, which was to be able to give users alternatives to fast fashion clothing. Although we struggled during the 
              development process, we were able to overcome the difficulty of learning a new framework under time constraints. Our main pain point was with some of the APIs,
              which initially did not work as intended. However, we were able to fix this in time. Although not all the features of the app are developed, we built it so that these 
              features can be implemented in the future. Because of our time constraint, we were unable to implement a price filtering option for our users. Again, this is something
              that we would like to do in the future, as well as figure out ways to encourage our users to practice sustainable fashion habits such as thrifting.
